excerpt: 'This paper focuses on the development of a microcontroller-based, low-cost test setup designed to estimate the State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) of lithium-ion batteries (LiB). It highlights the challenge of accurately quantifying SoC and SoH, despite many existing methods that often rely on detailed battery data during charge-discharge cycles. The proposed test system, equipped with a single bidirectional power converter, allows precise control over the charge and discharge processes through PI control loops. Additionally, the test set can monitor key parameters like battery voltage, current, and temperature, and transfer data via USB to a PC or flash drive for further analysis. The paper also presents the successful development of a laboratory prototype and demonstrates SoC estimation using multiple methods with test results.'
