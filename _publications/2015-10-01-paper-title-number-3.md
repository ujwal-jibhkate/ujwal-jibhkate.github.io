excerpt: 'This paper introduces a novel machine-learning approach to estimate the State of Charge (SOC) in lithium-ion batteries, which are commonly used in devices such as portable electronics and electric vehicles. Accurate SOC estimation is vital for improving battery performance and safety. The method builds on the traditional open-circuit voltage (OCV) and SOC relationship by modifying the OCV-SOC mapping technique and introducing a new parameter to enhance estimation accuracy. The approach is tested with multiple machine-learning algorithms, focusing on minimizing errors and improving reliability. Specifically, the paper highlights the effectiveness of using the XGBoost algorithm, which limits the root mean square error to less than 0.14% across various charge-discharge cycles, ensuring high accuracy over the battery's entire operational life.'
