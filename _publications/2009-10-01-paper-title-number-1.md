excerpt: 'This paper focuses on developing a low-complexity, data-based method for estimating the State of Charge (SOC) in lithium-ion batteries (LiB). The main challenge it addresses is the computational cost associated with SOC estimation, which limits the use of data-driven approaches on microcontrollers with low computational power.

To overcome this, the authors propose an open-circuit voltage (OCV) model based on a third-degree polynomial function with seven coefficients, offering a simple and efficient solution for SOC estimation. Additionally, they introduce a modification using a two-degree polynomial function that adjusts for the remaining useful life (RUL) to improve accuracy. The model is validated on experimental and standard datasets, achieving low error rates (below 0.01885 for the full SOC range and 0.01448 for partial ranges). This indicates that the model can provide reliable SOC estimations with minimal computational overhead.'
